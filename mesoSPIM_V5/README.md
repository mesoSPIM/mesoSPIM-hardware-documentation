## Dimensional accuracy

Depending on manufacturing method, the dimensions of machined/3D printed part can deviate from the 
"perfect" fit to a glass cuvette or Thorlabs component.
Machined parts have dimensional accuracy typically 0.05 - 0.1 mm, 3D printed parts 0.1 - 0.2 mm 
and uneven surface finish.

Several iterations with dimension adjustment of model or part may be necessary to accomodate your 
particular manufacturing method.

For metal or plastic machining with [Protolabs](https://www.protolabs.com/), accuracy 0.1 mm should be expected.

For 3D printers (0.1-0.2 mm), see articles

Stereolitography printers (such as [Form3](https://formlabs.com/)) are more accurate than 
extrusion-filament ones.

## 3D printing materials
Sample holders for BABB/DBE/BB-PEG immersion should be printed from nylon (polyamide), because these are powerful organic solvents.

Parts that do not contact with solvents can be printed from common plastics (PLA, ABS). ABS is mechanically stronger than PLA.

## Post-processing
If you use 3D printing, threads usually have to be tapped manually, and small holes drilled, even if they are "printed".

## CAD software
Most of the models (ipt files) were generated in Autodesk Inventor (free educational version). 
Migration to free open-source software (FreeCAD, Blender, OpenSCAD) is planned for future releases.
