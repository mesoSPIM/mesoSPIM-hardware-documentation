## Dimensional accuracy

Depending on manufacturing method, the dimensions of machined/3D printed part can deviate from the 
"perfect" fit to a glass cuvette or Thorlabs component.
Machined parts have dimensional accuracy typically 0.05 - 0.1 mm, 3D printed parts 0.1 - 0.2 mm 
and uneven surface finish.

Several iterations with dimension adjustment of model or part may be necessaty to accomodate your 
particular manufacturing accuracy.

For metal or plastic machining with [Protolabs](https://www.protolabs.com/), accuracy 0.1 mm should be expected.

For 3D printers (0.1-0.2 mm), see articles

* [Simplify3D: dimensional accuracy](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/dimensional-accuracy/)

Stereolitography printers (such as [Form3](https://formlabs.com/)) are more accurate than 
extrusion-filament ones.

## CAD software
Most of the models (ipt files) were generated in Autodesk Inventor (free educational version). 
Migration to free open-source software (FreeCAD, Blender, OpenSCAD) is planned for future releases.
